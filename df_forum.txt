CBM and Cybernoid

Ok, i have finally completed a tool for the Oric called CBM.
It is based around the AIC graphic technique used in games such as Stormlord and Impossible Mission.


The construction of most Platform games consists of Characters, Blocks and Maps (hence CBM).
On platforms other than the Oric, up to 256 Characters may be freed for use in games.
However the Oric only permits up to 96 characters in text mode and none in HIRES.

So Characters in HIRES are software driven only.
In CBM they are 6 by 6 pixels and there are 256 available).

Blocks are holders for characters and they also reduce the amount of memory by allowing certain shapes
to be duplicated. Blocks can be from 2 by 2 to 8 by 8 characters and up to 256 of them.

Maps are arenas or screens that hold blocks.

Below is the Files screen, the first screen you will see, showing the current map dimensions, memory usage and files options.

Below are the Block and Character Editor environments (with the Cybernoid project loaded) with the Character editor at the top and Block editor bottom-centre.

Next is the converted graphics from Cybernoid. It is much better with AIC to use original graphics but then alot more work.

The software is currently in beta testing but will be released soon.
